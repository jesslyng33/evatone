# Evatone
With our society's transition to an online world, it has become even harder for people with Autism to navigate peopleâ€™s emotions in online conversations. Thus, Evatone partners with online call services like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams to provide a real-time emotion detection tool to help with facial expression identification. This increases accessibility on their platforms for those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), emotional dysregulation, and alexithymia.

## To run our code:
1) Ensure that the typescript file has been compiled  to javascript by running "tsc camera.ts --outDir static/js" in terminal
2) Run the app.py file by running "python app.py" in terminal. This will open up a local host with a demo of our product.
